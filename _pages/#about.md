I am a researcher in [Operations Research and Analytics](https://www.informs.org/Explore/Operations-Research-Analytics), and I lecture a wide range of quantitative courses in mathematics, computer science, business, and operations. 

My main research interests are modeling (optimization and simulation) and algorithmic aspects (exact, metaheuristics, and hybrid methods) of various problems arising in logistics. 

In line with the enormous amount of progress in machine learning and deep learning, particularly over the last few years, I have also become interested in ML techniques and algorithms that can be used to improve the performance of classical solution techniques.


#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The #code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the #YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) #automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
