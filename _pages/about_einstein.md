I am a researcher in [Operations Research and Analytics](https://www.informs.org/Explore/Operations-Research-Analytics), and I lecture a wide range of quantitative courses in mathematics, computer science, business, and operations. 

My main research interests are modeling (optimization and simulation) and algorithmic aspects (exact, metaheuristics, and hybrid methods) of various problems arising in logistics. 

In line with the enormous amount of progress in machine learning and deep learning, particularly over the last few years, I have also become interested in ML techniques and algorithms that can be used to improve the performance of classical solution techniques.
